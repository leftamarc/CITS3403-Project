    For every 1 point higher a game's Metacritic score is, you play on average <strong>{{ (slope) | round(2) }}</strong> more hours.<br>
    The overall relationship between Metacritic score and your playtime is <strong>{{ corr }}</strong>.

    {% if corr < 0.1 %}
    So, basically, you're just out here ignoring quality entirely. Do you even read reviews, or do you just pick games at random? Bold strategy.

    {% elif 0.1 <= corr < 0.3 %}
    A very weak correlation. You might glance at the score, but it barely nudges your playtime. Maverick energy.

    {% elif 0.3 <= corr < 0.6 %}
    A moderate correlation. You probably check the Metacritic score, nod thoughtfully, and then do whatever you were going to do anyway. Classic.

    {% elif 0.6 <= corr < 0.8 %}
    A strong correlation. You’re starting to look like someone who lets the critics decide what’s worth playing. Conformist tendencies detected.

    {% elif corr >= 0.8 %}
    Wow, a very strong correlation. Do you even have opinions of your own, or do you just let Metacritic run your life? Peak conformist energy.

    {% endif %}
