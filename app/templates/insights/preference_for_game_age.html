<p class="card-text">
    A regression analysis revealed that you have a preference for the <strong>{{ preference }}</strong> in your library.

    {% if slope > 1 %}
        You strongly favor modern games. We're surprised the daycare gives you so much computer time.
    {% elif 1 > slope > 0.5 %}
        You clearly prefer modern games. Related, you were clearly born after 2010.
    {% elif 0.5 > slope > 0 %}
        You slightly lean toward modern games. Don’t worry, we won’t call you a full-on baby... yet.
    {% elif slope < -1 %}
        You strongly favor older games. Boomer.
    {% elif -1 <= slope < -0.5 %}
        You seem to enjoy older games. Nostalgia hitting hard, or are you just avoiding the new stuff?
    {% elif -0.5 <= slope < 0 %}
        You slightly prefer older games, but your playtime is fairly balanced across your library.
    {% else %}
        You have no clear preference for game age. A true neutral—how diplomatic of you.
    {% endif %}
